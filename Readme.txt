Hey there! These projects are just a small fraction (unfortunately I lost one of the drives where I stored my other gamemaker/unity/c/cpp projects) of what I made way back when I was around 11 - 12. We all gotta start somewhere, right? It's like a blast from the past for me to look at these again. This repo serves as a time capsule. I managed to recover some of them from an old drive and decided to throw them on github.
