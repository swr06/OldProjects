Hey there! These projects I'm sharing with you are just a small fraction of what I made way back when I was around 11 or 12. We all gotta start somewhere, right? It's like a blast from the past for me to look at these again and remember coding these. This repo serves as a time capsule. I managed to recover some of them from an old drive and decided to throw them on github.
